Python library for controlling a Pioneer AVR via its built-in API.

Used by the [pioneer_async](https://github.com/crowbarz/ha-pioneer_async) integration for Home Assistant, which was inspired by the [original Pioneer Home Assistant integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/pioneer/).
Originally developed and tested on a VSX-930 (Main Zone and HDZone outputs) but has since been [tested on a larger set of models by the community](https://github.com/crowbarz/ha-pioneer_async/issues/20).

## Features

- Implemented in asyncio.
- Maintains single continuous telnet session to AVR, with automatic reconnect.
- Eliminates status polling where AVR sends keepalive responses (on port 8102).
- Auto-detects Zones 1, 2, 3 and HDZONE.
- Ignore specific zones, for AVRs that report phantom zones.
- Automatically polls AVR for source names - no longer need to manually code them in your config any more if your AVR supports their retrieval. Can also set source names manually.
- Queries device parameters: MAC address, software version, model.
- Ability to set internal parameters to change the API functionality, eg. maximum volume, volume step change delta.
- Defaults for internal parameters can be changed based on custom profiles based on AVR model.
- Includes workaround for AVRs with an initial volume set on the Main Zone (eg. VSX-930).
- Supports AVRs that do not support setting the volume level by emulating using up/down commands (eg. VSX-S510).
- Command line client for sending commands and testing
- Supports all listening mode functions
- Supports all video related functions
- Supports panel and remote locking
- Supports most AMP related functions
- Supports all tone functions
- Supports most zone power functions
- Supports all zone input functions
- Supports all zone volumne and mute functions
- Supports setting of tuner band and preset
- Supports setting frequency directly for capable AVRs, and also by stepping the frequency up/down

## Params

There are several types of parameters that modify the library's functionality. These are listed below in order of increasing priority:

- **Default parameters**: these are the defaults for all of the parameters
- **Model parameters**: these parameters are determined by the AVR model as detected by the library. Custom profiles for specific AVR models are defined in [`aiopioneer/param.py](https://github.com/crowbarz/aiopioneer/blob/main/aiopioneer/param.py)
- **User parameters**: these parameters are provided by the user at instantiation, and can also be updated via the `set_user_params` method
- **System parameters**: these parameters are set by the library at run time

Where a parameter is specified at more than one level, the higher priority parameter takes precedence. So a user specified parameter will override any value that is determined by the AVR model.

**NOTE:** YAML syntax is used in the table below. Use Python equivalents (`false` -> `False`, `true` -> `True`, `null` -> `None` etc.) when calling the Python API directly, and JSON syntax if manually specifying via the Home Assistant integration.

| Name | Type | Default | Description
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -----------
| `ignored_zones` | list | `[]` | List of zones to ignore even if they are auto-discovered. Specify Zone IDs as strings:Â "1", "2", "3" and "Z".
| `command_delay` | float | `0.1` | Insert a delay between sequential commands that are sent to the AVR. This appears to make the AVR behave more reliably during status polls. Increase this value if debug logging shows that your AVR times out between commands.
| `max_source_id` | int | `60` | Maximum source ID that the source discovery queries. Reduce this if your AVR returns errors.
| `max_volume` | int | `185` | Maximum volume for the Main Zone.
| `max_volume_zonex` | int | `185` | Maximum volume for zones other than the Main Zone.
| `power_on_volume_bounce` | bool | `false` | On some AVRs (eg. VSX-930) where a power-on is set, the initial volume is not reported by the AVR correctly until a volume change is made. This option enables a workaround that sends a volume up and down command to the AVR on power-on to correct the reported volume without affecting the power-on volume.
| `volume_step_only` | bool | `false` | On some AVRs (eg. VSX-S510), setting the volume level is not supported natively by the API. This option emulates setting the volume level using volume up and down commands.
| `ignore_volume_check` | bool | `false` | Don't check volume when determining whether a zone exists on the AVR. Useful for AVRs with an HDZone that passes through audio.
| `zone_1_sources` | list | `[]` | (>0.4) Customises the available sources for use with Zone 1. Defaults to all available sources.
| `zone_2_sources` | list | [see source](https://github.com/crowbarz/aiopioneer/blob/dev/aiopioneer/param.py#L61) | Customises the available sources for use with Zone 2 (some AVRs do not support all sources).
| `zone_3_sources` | list | [see source](https://github.com/crowbarz/aiopioneer/blob/dev/aiopioneer/param.py#L61) | Customises the available sources for use with Zone 3 (some AVRs do not support all sources).
| `hdzone_sources` | list | [see source](https://github.com/crowbarz/aiopioneer/blob/dev/aiopioneer/param.py#L61)` | Customises the available sources for use with HDZone (some AVRs do not support all sources).
| `hdzone_volume_requirements` | list | `["13", "15", "05", "25"]` | A list of sources that HDZone must be set to for volume control, some AVRs do not support HDZone volume at all (see `ignore_volume_check` above) and some only allow control of certain sources.
| `amp_speaker_system_modes` | dict | `....` | Customises the names of speaker system modes. Different generations of AVR will name zones slighty differently. For example, the SC-LX57 names speaker system mode `15` as `5.1ch Bi-Amp + ZONE2` however this can also be called `5.2ch Bi-Amp + HDZONE` on newer AVRs.
| `extra_amp_listening_modes` | dict | [see source](https://github.com/crowbarz/aiopioneer/blob/dev/aiopioneer/const.py#L24) | (>0.5) Additional listening modes that are added to the list of all possible listening modes for the AVR. This list is used to decode the listening mode ID returned by the AVR. See the source for the format for listening mode definition.
| `enabled_amp_listening_modes` | list | `[]` | (>0.5) A list of listening mode IDs to be made available for selection. If specified, then no listening mode IDs will be included by default. All enabled source names must be unique, and duplicated names are ignored. The additional listening modes must be actually supported by the AVR, and will return an error (usually `E02`) when an unsupported listening mode is selected. This list is predefined for some AVRs, and specifying this parameter manually will override the model specific default disable list.
| `disabled_amp_listening_modes` | list | `[]` | A list of listening mode IDs to be disabled. Listening mode IDs that are also specified in `enabled_amp_listening_modes` will be disabled. This list is predefined for some AVRs, and specifying this parameter manually will override the model specific default disable list.
| `video_resolution_modes` | list | `['0', '1', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']` | Sets the available video resolutions. Not all AVRs support the same resolution settings. This defaults to all of the latest resolutions from FY16.
| `mhl_source` | string | `null` | Sets the MHL source ID. This is used for media controls. This information cannot be queried automatically
| `enabled_functions` | list | `["amp", "dsp", "tuner", "tone", "channels", "video", "system", "audio"]` | Change the functions that are enabled by the API, adding more functions will increase the amount of time it takes to complete a full init and update.
| `disable_auto_query` | bool | `false` | Setting to `true` will disable auto queries on init for all functions apart from basic functionality (power, source, volume and mute). If you only need those functions, you can set this to `true`
| `am_frequency_step` | int | `null` | Optional setting to configure the AM frequency step. If this is set to `null`, a function is queued to detect this information by stepping up and down the frequency when the tuner is first used while set to AM.
| `debug_listener` | bool | `false` | Enables additional debug logging for the listener task.
| `debug_responder` | bool | `false` | Enables additional debug logging for the responder task.
| `debug_updater` | bool | `false` | Enables additional debug logging for the updater task.
| `debug_command` | bool | `false` | Enables additional debug logging for commands sent and responses received.

If your model of AVR always needs specific parameters to be set for the library to function properly, then please create a PR to add a custom profile for the AVR model.

  `_PioneerAVR.__init__()` no longer accepts `command_delay`, `volume_workaround` and `volume_steps` arguments. Configure these parameters using the equivalent `PARAM_*` keys in the `params` dict, passed in via the constructure or set via `set_user_params()`.
